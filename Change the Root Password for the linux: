Jira : TO-274820, CINC-55057
Type : [Technology - Repaver]
Issue:The indexer repaving task was started but the repaving was not working. There was an error â€œAll requirements are not met yet.  reason: requirement failed: Active Peer Count: 3 is < 6; retrying in 30 seconds"
Resolution: We engaged the TO-E to get the suggestion on the next steps. We also found that there were 2 similar incidents we faced in the past where we reproved the indexers using the manual process. TO-E wnet through them and provided confirmation to go with the manual upgrade.
